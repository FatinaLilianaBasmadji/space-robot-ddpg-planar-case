# space-robot-ddpg

This repository is related to the use of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for planning the motion of a space manipulator.

The parameters of the space robot used here are the same parameters as those of the space robot at the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences. More information about this space robot and the microgravity testbed can be found in our paper:
